# Brendan's Data Science Portfolio
Hello! If you're reading this, then you have found my Data Science GitHub Portfolio. Welcome.

A the root level of this Repository, you will find different directories that contain within them specific projects targeted at some of the more common Data Science questions today, such as exploratory data analysis, regression/prediction, and classification of dichotomous/binary outcome varaibles. Choose a subfolder, and then further read the readme in that folder for more information about where you are, and what there is to see.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio.

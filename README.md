# Brendan Stevens' Data Science Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my Data Science GitHub Portfolio.

A the root level of this Repository, you will find different directories targeted at some of the more common Data Science tasks today, such as exploratory data analysis, regression, and classification. Within each themed directory, you will find modules of projects that have been split into bite-sized, focused tasks, along with directory descriptions to help further guide you.

If you have any questions for me

Thank you for viewing my portfolio.

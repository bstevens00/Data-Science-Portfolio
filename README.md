# Data-Science-Portfolio
Hello! If you're reading this, then you have found my Data Science GitHub Portfolio.

A the root level of this Repository, you will find different directories that contain within them specific projects targetted at tackling some of the more common Data Science questions today, such as exploratory data analysis, continuous response variable prediction, and classification prediction in the form of dichotomous outcome varaibles. Choose a subfolder, and then further read the readme in that folder for more information about where you are, and what there is to see.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio. I hope you enjoy your stay!

# Comparing Countries, Continents, Communities, and... Conspiracies during COVID

## Spoiler - The Bottom Line

While the United States has had almost twice the deaths as any other country from Covid in raw numbers, the percentage of deaths out of the total population and out of the total of those infected are both in line with the rest of the world. In fact, the one could make a reasonable case that the single group that has handled the pandemic the worst would be the European continent, as 8 of 10 of the highest infection rates per population and death rates per infected have occurred there.

## The Goals - Why do this? Why?

The pandemic has had a major influence on all of our lives. This project was born out of my natural instinct to "see for myself" what the infection rates, death counts, and side-by-side comparisons at the country, continent, and world level have been. We all have family members who trust the government and the vaccinations as well as those who seem to think there's a conspiracy afoot.

So as to be impartial, I thought it prudent to analyze the United States in isolation first, lining up a list of queries that I wanted to ask the data, including:

* How many people have gotten sick with Covid as a raw number?
* How many people have gotten sick with Covid out of the total population as a percentage?
* How many people have died with Covid as a raw number?
* How many people have died with Covid out of the total population as a percentage?
* How many people have died with Covid out of the total who have gotten sick?

After setting up these questions, I decided to ask the very same questions of all the other countries, and compare them to the USA.

## The Results

When comparing the United States to all the other countries in the world, the United States has recorded almost *double* the death count of the next highest country. This, by itself, was alarming. And if I'm being honest, it made me wonder for a brief second about those conspiracies!

However, almost immediately to the contrary, I was shown that there was no reason to assume anything out of the ordinary, as the USA recorded a "normal" death rate as a percentage of the population in when compared to the other countries in the dataset. That is to say, the United States had a death rate percentage close to the mean or average of all the countries in comparison, indicating relative normality. Well, as normal as a widespread pandemic *can* be.

In addition to this, the percentage of those who have contracted and tested positive for COVID in the USA is relatively similar to the rest of the countries.

This analysis was a great example of how large numbers, when out of context and only shown without the "whole" they are a part of, can be misleading. It doesn't make sense to compare the total deaths in the USA to the total deaths of Canada, because Canada has 1/10th the population of the United States. It makes much more sense to compare the percentages.

## Going Further
If I were to go further with this analysis, I would break down the COVID numbers by demographics and population density. In addition, I would analyze the data with the help of a geographic map tool, such as the one in Tableau, taking into consideration the climate of the country, as research has shown COVID to be sensitive to heat, lasting a shorter amount of time on surfaces in hotter climates.

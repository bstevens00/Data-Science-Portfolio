Classification Models

At this level, you see see multiple directories. Let's break down what the name means on a folder by looking at an example.

"1a_knn_student_gender_classification.R"

• "1" - The "1" indicates that you're looking at a file from "Project 1". Every directory with a "1" in its title is associated with this project. This extends beyond this folder. If you go up a directory from here, and then go down into the "Exploratory Data Analysis" folder, there is also a 1 file there, which is the first part of this project. All directories titled "Project 1" are from the same project.

• "a" - An index that keeps track of the order of how you should look through the files if you wish to read through the entire project. File "a" comes before "b" in the projects.

• "KNN" - This is the learning/classification method used. For file 1a, the method of classification being used is K-Nearest Neighbors.

• "student_gender_classification" - This is the name of Project 1.

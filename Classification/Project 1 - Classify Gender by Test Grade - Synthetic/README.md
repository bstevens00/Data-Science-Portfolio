Classification Models

At this level, you see see multiple directories. Let's break down what the name means on a folder by looking at an example.

"1a - KNN - Classify Gender by Test Grade - Synthetic"

• "1" - The "1" indicates "Project 1" in this portfolio. Every directory with a "1" in its title is associated with this project. This extends beyond this classification folder. If you go up a directory from here, and then go down into the "Exploratory Data Analysis" folder, there is also a 1 file there, which is part of Project 1. Just remember that all directories that start with the same number are adjoined.

• "a" - An index that keeps track of the order of how you should look through the files if you wish to read through the entire project. Directory "a" comes before "b" in the projects.

• "KNN" - This is the learning/classification method used. For file 1a, the method of classification used was K-Nearest Neighbors.

• "Classify Gender by Test Grade" - This is the name of Project 1.

• "Synthetic" - This label means that the data for Project 1 was arificially created for the purposes of machine learning practice or otherwise. The method by which it was created may be random, using a theoretical distribution, etc. The opposite label, "Organic", means that the data was collected by myself or another party from real life sources, such as clinical observations, manual collection, webscraping, etc.
